electrophoresis


Personal Projects
________________________________________________________________
Camera Calibration (May 2022 - Present)
● Created realtime 2D camera intrinsic and extrinsic value detection in C++

Gitlet (June 2023 - August 2023)
● Utilized the Java standard library to successfully implement simplified version of
Git's core control system essential features such as init, add, commit, log, branch,
merge, reset, and restore
● Employed the Serializable interface to facilitate data serialization into a .gitlet
directory, allowing efficient storage of historical file versions and commit trees.

BYOW: https://youtu.be/DTPf2xvE5gI (June 2023 - August 2023)
• Designed a game that pseudo randomly generated user explorable worlds for
different seed numbers in Java that creates paths efficiently.
• Influenced the path of each room using search algorithms such as DFS and Dijstra’s
algorithm.

Tennis Racket Cross-Weaver:  (August 2022 - November 2022)
● Utilized 3D CAD technology to develop a prototype, revolutionizing the racket
manufacturing process.
● Achieved a remarkable reduction in re-stringing time while maintaining overall racket
performance.

Urinalysis Prototype: https://youtu.be/S0Pqcitn0p8 (June 2019 - August 2019)
● Employed OpenCV, Numpy, and Matplotlib to develop sophisticated software in
Python, enabling camera-based urine analysis.
● Merged software proficiency with domain knowledge to facilitate real-time detection
and assessment of urine-strip characteristics.
● Pioneered the design of the urinalysis prototype using 3D CAD software, seamlessly
integrating form and function to ensure user-friendly operation and accurate results.
